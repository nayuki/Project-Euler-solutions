(* Use this in Wolfram Mathematica *)

(* 
 * The key insight is to use dynamic programming to build up the answer one digit at a time.
 * 
 * Let Num(n, s) denote the set of numbers of length n (with leading zeros) whose squared digits sum to s.
 * For example, Num(2, 25) = {05, 34, 43, 50}.
 * Then for any particular n and s, we know that Num(n, s) = union of
 *   (prepend 0 to each of Num(n-1, s - 0*0)),
 *   (prepend 1 to each of Num(n-1, s - 1*1)),
 *   ...,
 *   (prepend 9 to each of Num(n-1, s - 9*9)).
 * 
 * However, keeping track of these sets of numbers explicitly is just as slow as iterating over
 * all the numbers by brute force. So instead, we only store the sums and counts of these sets,
 * and these two pieces of information are enough to determine the final answer.
 * (Furthermore, these can be reduced by the modulus.)
