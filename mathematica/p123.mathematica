(* Use this in Wolfram Mathematica *)

(* 
 * Using the result from Project Euler #120, we know that (a-1)^n + (a+1)^n mod a^2 = if n is even then 2 else 2an. Since 2 is tiny, we can skip the n is even case.
 * a is the n'th (1-based) prime number, so a > n. In fact for n >= 5, we have a > 2n, so we can take 2an directly without moduloing it by a^2.

n = 5;
While[2n * Prime[n] <= 10^10, n += 2]
