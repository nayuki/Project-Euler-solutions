(* 
 * Repunit formula: R(k) = (10^k - 1) / 9. (Using geometric series)
 * 
 * For the rest of the argument, let n be an arbitrary integer that is coprime with 10.
 * 
 * Let k = A(n) be the smallest positive integer such that R(k) = 0 mod n.
 * From problem #129, we know k exists and satisfies 1 <= k <= n.
 * 
 * Lemma: For each natural number m, R(m) = 0 mod n if and only if m is a multiple of k.
 * Proof:
 *   Backward direction:
 *     Assume m is a multiple of k. Then factorize m = jk, where j is an integer.
 *     Look at R(m) = R(jk) = 1...1 ... 1...1 (j groups of k 1's) = 10...010...010...01 * R(k) (informally)
 *                  = (sum of 10^(ik) for i = 0 to s-1) * R(k).
 *     We already have R(k) = 0 mod n, thus (sum of 10^(ik) for i = 0 to s-1) * R(k) = R(m) = 0 mod n.
 *   Forward direction (by converse):
 *     Assume m is not a multiple of k. Suppose for contradiction that R(m) = 0 mod n.
 *     Similar the previous argument, we can zeroize blocks of k 1's while preserving the value of R(m) mod n.
 *     Namely, we delete the top k 1's by subtracting R(k) * 10^(m-k), which is 0 mod n because R(k) = 0 mod n.
 *     After repeated deletion of the most significant 1's, we can get m' = m mod k, so that 0 < m' < k.
 *     (m' != 0 because we assumed m is not a multiple of k.) But with R(m') = R(m) = 0 mod n, and m' < k,
 *     this contradicts the definition of k = A(n), the smallest value such that R(k) = 0 mod n.
 *     Hence the supposition that R(m) = 0 mod n is false.
 * 
 * Does there exist an x such that R(10^x) is a multiple of n? By the lemma, this is true if and only if
 * there exists an x such that 10^x is a multiple of k. This means k must be a product of 2's and 5's.
 * 
 * Actually, we don't need to compute k = A(n) to perform this test. If k = 2^a * 5^b, then all sufficiently large
 * powers of 10 are a multiple of k. (If k has other prime factors, then no power of 10 is a multiple of k.)
 * We know 1 <= k < n, so in this problem 1 <= k < 10^5. For k in this range, the largest exponent among a and b is 16
 * (for the number 2^16 = 65536). (In general, the largest exponent is floor(log2(limit)); in this case limit = 10^5.)
 * So we only need to test if 10^16 is a multiple of k, equivalent to testing if R(10^16) is a multiple of n.
