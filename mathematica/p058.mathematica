(* 
 * From the diagram, let's observe the four corners of an n * n square (where n is odd).
 * It's not hard to convince yourself that:
 * - The bottom right corner always has the value n^2.
 * Working clockwise (backwards):
 * - The bottom left corner has the value n^2 - (n - 1).
 * - The top left corner has the value n^2 - 2(n - 1).
 * - The top right has the value n^2 - 3(n - 1).
 * 
 * Furthermore, the number of elements on the diagonal is 2n - 1.
