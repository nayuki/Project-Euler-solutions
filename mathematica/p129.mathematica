(* Use this in Wolfram Mathematica *)

(* 
 * Let n >= 1 be arbitrary but assume that it is coprime with 10.
 * We want to find the smallest k such that R(k) = 0 mod n, and we'll show that 1 <= k <= n.
 * 
 * Let "the sequence" of n values be (R(1) mod n, R(2) mod n, R(3) mod n, ..., R(n) mod n).
 * For the sake of contradiction, assume that none of the values in the sequence are 0.
 * 
 * Each number in the sequence is an integer in the range [1, n).
 * The range has n - 1 elements, but there are n elements in the sequence.
 * Hence by the pigeonhole principle, there exist two distinct indexes
 * in the sequence where the elements have the same value.
 * 
 * Suppose the two distinct indexes (1-based) are i and j.
 * So the two values in question are R(i) mod n and R(j) mod n.
 * Suppose WLOG that j > i. Then clearly R(j) - R(i) = 0 mod n,
 * and so R(j) - R(i) = 1...10...0 = R(j - i) * 10^i = 0 mod n.
 * 
 * Since 10 is coprime with n, 10 (and its powers) are invertible modulo n.
 * Multiply everything in the equation by 10^-i, and we get R(j - i) = 1...1 = 0 mod n.
 * 
 * We know 1 <= j - i <= n - 1. Then R(i - j) mod n, which is 0, is in the sequence.
 * This contradicts our assumption that none of (R(1), R(2), ... R(n)) is 0 mod n.
 * 
 * Therefore if we want to find an n whose solution k is such that
 * k > 1000000, then we need to have n > 1000000.
