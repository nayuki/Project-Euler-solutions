(* Use this in Wolfram Mathematica *)

(* 
 * Consider an arbitrary fraction n/d:
 *   Let n = 10 * n1 + n0 be the numerator.
 *   Let d = 10 * d1 + d0 be the denominator.
 * As stated in the problem, we need 10 <= n < d < 100.
 * We must disregard trivial simplifications where n0 = d0 = 0.
 * 
 * Now, a simplification with n0 = d0 is impossible because:
 *   n1 / d1 = n / d = (10*n1 + n0) / (10*d1 + n0).
 *   n1 * (10*d1 + n0) = d1 * (10*n1 + n0).
 *   10*n1*d1 + n1*n0 = 10*d1*n1 + d1*n0.
 *   n1*n0 = d1*n0.
 *   n1 = d1.
 *   This implies n = d, which contradicts the fact that n < d.
 * Similarly, we cannot have a simplification with n1 = d1 for the same reason.
 * 
 * Therefore we only need to consider the cases where n0 = d1 or n1 = d0.
 * In the first case, check that n1/d0 = n/d;
 * in the second case, check that n0/d1 = n/d.
